# LCHS-Tetrys  
Tetrys is **BACK** *baby*!!  
This is an extension built on <a style = "color: red;" href = "https://github.com/kris10ansn">@kris10ansn's</a> popular Tetrys game made for the LCHS bell schedule.  
Following the complete ban of the first Tetrys game, I decided to build one on top of the orginal to create one allowing people to play the game during non-class periods (or during class periods with a special token).  
This extension also has several aesthical updates to the original.
## How do I use it?
As of March 2 2022, you can only access it by hosting on a `localhost` server. To do so, follow the steps below.  
On the command line, cd into the repo:
```cd LCHS-Tetrys```  
Then execute the following command (you need to have Python installed):
```python -m http.server```  
This should open up a `localhost` server on port 8000. Simply type *localhost:8000* into your search bar and tetrys should pop up!  
  
As of March 4 2022, you can now download it from the Chrome Web Store! Click [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lchs-tetrys/mjkojlieihhabpbgejagmcibeokpnahb) to download.
